# fxml
Basic XML parser in C with no dependencies. MIT Licensed. Neither terribly efficient nor terribly bloated. Ignores declarations, validations, doctypes, and all that other bullshit. Namespaces are treated as part of the tag name. No idea what paser acronym this one qualifies as. The "f" stands for what you think it does.
